Labels are used to indicate the places where jump instructions should jump to, and they give names to callable assembly language procedures. 

Here are the most important things to know about labels: 

	A) Labels must begin with a letter, or else with an underscore, period, or question mark. These last three have special meanings to the assembler, so don't use them until you know how NASM interprets them. 

	B) Labels must be followed by a colon when they are defined. 

	C) Labels are case sensitive. 

THe following machine instruction transfers the flow of instruction execution to the location marked by the label "GoHome:"

			jmp GoHome

The colon is only placed where the label is defined, not where it is referenced. 
Think of it this way: use the colon when you are marking a location, not when you are going there. 

The "_start" label indicates where the program begins. 
Every Linux assembly language program has to be marked this way, and with the precise label "_start". 

Furthermore, this label must be marked as global at the top of the .text section, as shown. 

This is a requirement of the Linux operating system. 
Every executable program for Linux has to have a label "_start" in it somewhere, irrespective of the language it's written in: C, Pascal, assembly, no matter.. 
If the Linux loader can't find the label, it can't load the program correctly. 
The "global" specifier tells the linker to make the "_start" label visible from outside the program's borders.
