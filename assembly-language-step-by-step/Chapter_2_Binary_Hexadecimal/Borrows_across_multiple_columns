What happens is that the middle two 0s act as loan brokers between the F and the rightmost 0, keeping their commission in the form of enough value to allow their own columns; subtractions to take place. 
Each column to the right of the last column borrows 10 from its neighbor to the left, and loans 1 to the neightbor on its right. 
After all the borrows trickle through the upper number, what we have looks like a cross-outs in base 10 subtraction. 

At this point, each columnar subtraction can take place, and the difference is B494H.
