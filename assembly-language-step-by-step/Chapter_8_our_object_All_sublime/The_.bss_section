When you're reading data from a disk file, for example, you need to have a place for the data to go after it comes in from disk. 
Data buffers like that are defined in the .bss section of your program. 
You set aside some number of bytes for a buffer and give the buffer a name, but you don't say what values are to be present in the buffer. 
There's a crucial defferenece between data items defined in the .data section and data items defined in the .bss section add to the size of your executable file. 
Data items in the .bss section do not.
Having an empty .bss section does not increase the size of your executable file, and deleting an empty .bss section does not make your executeable file any smaller.
