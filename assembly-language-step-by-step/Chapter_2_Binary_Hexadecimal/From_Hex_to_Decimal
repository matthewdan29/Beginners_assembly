Converting hex numbers to decimal is a good deal easier than going the other way. 
Derive the value represented by each individual column in the hex number, and then add all the column values in decimal. 
The hex number is 7A2. 
Start at the right column. 
This is the units column in any number system. 
You have 2 units, so enter 2 into your calculator. 
Not store that 2 into memory. 
Keep in mind that what you're really doing is keeping a running tally of values of  the columns in the hex number. 
Move to the next column to the left. 
Remember that  in the hex, each column represents a value 16 times the value of the column to its right, so the second column from the right is the 16s column. (Refer to "Hexadecimal_columns_as_powers_of_16_chart_written_Yes_this_is_very_important" text if you lose track of the column values.) 
The 16s column has a A in it. 
A in hex is decimal 10. 
The total value of that column, therfore, is 16 X 10, or 160. 
Perform that multiplication on your calculator and add the product to the 2 that you stored in memory. 

Remember what you're doing: evaluating each column in decimal and keeping a running total. 
Now move to the thrid column from the right. 
This one contains a 7. 
The value of the third column is 16 X 16, or 256. 
Multiply 256 X 7 on your calculator, and add the product to your running total. 
Retrieve the running total from your calculator memory. 
The total should be 1954, which is the decimal equivalent of 7A2H. 

Try C6F0DBH: 

	1) Evaluate the units column. B X 1 = 11 X 1 = 11. 

	2) Evaluate the 16s column. D X 16 = 13 X 16 = 208. Add 208 to your running total

	3) Evaluate the 256s column. 0 X 256 = 0. 

	4) Evaluate the 4096s column. F X 4096 = 15 X 4096 = 61440. 

	5) Evaluate the 65536s column. 6 X 65536 - 393216. 

	6) Evaluate the 1048,576s column. C X 1048576 = 12 X 1048578 = 12582912. 

The running total should be 13037383

Finaly the number: 1A55BEH. 

	1) 14 X 1 = 14

	2) Next is the 16's place. 11 X 16 = 176.

	3) Next is the 16 X 16 = 256s place.  16 X 16 = 256, 256 X 5 = 1280

	4) Next is the 16 X 16 X 16 = 4096s place. 16 X 16 X 16 = 4096, 4096 X 5 = 20480

	5) Next is the 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 = 65536s place. 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 = 65536, 65536 X 10 = 655360 

	6) Next is the 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 = 1048576s place. 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 X 16 = 1048576, 1048576 X 1 = 1048576

	7) Next you have to add all the values up into 1 sum. It equals 1725886
