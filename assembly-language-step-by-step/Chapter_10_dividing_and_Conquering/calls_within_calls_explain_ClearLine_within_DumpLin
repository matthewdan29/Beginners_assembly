(NOTE: ".poke"-- In older programming context like BASIC, "POKE <address>, <value>" was an instrctuion to store a value in memory)

Within a procedure you can do anything that you can do within the main program itself. 
This includes calling other procedures from within a procedure, and makeing "INT 80h" calls to Linux Kernel services. 
There's a simple example in hexdump2: The 'ClearLine' procedure calls the 'DumpChar' procedure to "clear" the hex dump line varibale 'DumpLin': 
			
			ClearLine: 
				pushad			; Save all caller's GP registers
				mov edx, 15		; We're going to go 16 pokes, counting from 0
			.poke:  move eax, 0		; Tell DumpChar to poke a '0'
				call DumpChar		; IInsert the '0' into the hex dump string 
				sub edx, 1		; DEC doesn't affect CF!
				jae .poke		; Loop back if EDX >= 0
				popad			; Restore all caller's GP registers 
				ret 			; Go home

Basically, what 'ClearLine' does is make a special-case use of the 'DumpChar' procedure. 
When filled with data and displayed to the console, the 'DumpLin' varibale looks like this: 
	75, 6D, 70, 32, 2E, 61, 73, 6D 0A, 09, 6E, 61, 73, 6D, 20, 2D |ump2.asm...nasm - |

Each two-character hex value, and each ASCII character in the ASCII column on the right, was inserted by a single call to 'DumpChar' to "fill" the 'DumpLin' variable. 
At that point it can be displayed. 
After "DumpLin" is displayed to the console, hexdump2 continues its loop and begins filling 'DumpLin' again. 
Every 16 calls to 'DumpChar', hexdump2 displays 'DumLin' to the console ... exectp for the last time. 

A file being dumped to the console might not be a precise multiple of 16 bytes long, so the final display of 'DumpLin' could be a partial line of two, three, nine, eleven, or however many characters less than sixteen. 
When a partial line is displayed, the last several bytes in the line dump may be "old" data sent to the console on the previous display of 'DumpLin'. 
To avoid this 'DumpLin' is cleared to zero values immediately after each display. 
This is what 'ClearLine' does. 
After all to 'ClearLine', 'DumpLin' looks like this: 

		00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 | ................ |
'ClearLine' does the simple and obvious thing: It calls 'DumpChar' 16 times, each time passes 'CumpChar' the value 0 in EAX. 
'DumpChar' "pokes" and ASCII equivalent of both the hex value 00 and an ASCII period to represent the 0 value in all positions in the ASCII column.
