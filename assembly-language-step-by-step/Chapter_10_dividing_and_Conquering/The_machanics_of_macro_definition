A macro definition looks a little like a procedure definition, framed between a pair of special NASM directives: '%MACRO' and "%ENDMACRO". 
Note that the "%ENDMACRO" directive is on the line after the last line of the macro. 
Don't make the mistake of treating "%ENDMACRO" like a label that marks the macro's last line. 
One minor shortcoming of macros vis-a-vis procedures is that macros can have only one entry point. 
A macro, after all is a sequence of code lines that are inserted into your program in the midst of the flow of execution. 
You don't call a macro and you don't return from it. 
The CPU runs through it just as the CPU runs through any sequence of instructions. 
Many or most procedures may be expressed as macros with a little care. 
In 'eatmacro.asm' the program from 'eatterm.asm' converts all the procedures to macros so that you can see differenced between the two approaches. 

Compare the macros in eatmacro with their procedure equivalents in eaterm. 
Thy've shed their 'RET' instructions (and for thos macros that invoke other macros, their 'CALL' instructions), but for the most part they consist of almost precisely the same code. 
Macros are invoked simply by nameing them.
Again, don't use the "CALL" insturction. 
Just place the macro's name on a line: 
			ClrScr

The assembler will handle the rest
