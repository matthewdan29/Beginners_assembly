To assemble a file, you issue a command of the form 

		nasm -f <format> <filename> [-o <output>]

For example 
		nasm -f elf myfile.asm

Will assemble myfile.asm into a 32-bit ELF object file myfile.o And 

		nasm -f bin myfile.asm -o myfile.com

will assemble myfile.asm into a raw binary file 'myfile.com'

To produce a listing file, with the hex codes output from NASM displayed on the left of the orginal sources, use the -l options to give a listing file name, for example: 

		nasm -f coff myfile.asm -l myfile.lst

To get further usage instructions from NASM, try typing 
		nasm -h

The option --help is an alias for the -h option

Like Unix compiler and assemblers, NASM is silent unless it goes wrong: you won't see any output at all, unless it gives error messages,
