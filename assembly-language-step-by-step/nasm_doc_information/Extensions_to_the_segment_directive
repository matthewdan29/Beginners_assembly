The obj output format extends the SEGMENT (or section) directive to allow you to specify various properties of the segment you are defining. 
This is done by appending extra qualifers to the end of the segment-definition line. 
For example: 

			segment code private align=16

defines the segment code, but also declares it to be a private segment, and requires that the protion of it described in this code module must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
