Working with NASM can create programs large enough that you will encounter this error below. 

	error: short jump is out of range

This error occurs when a conditional jump instruction is too far from the label that it refereces, where "too far" means too many locations away in memory. 
This only applies to conditional jumps; the unconditional jump instruction 'JMP' is not subject to this error. 
The problem arises because of the different ways that NASM can generate a binary opcode for a particular conditional jump instruciton. 

There is a thrid kind of jump called a 'far jump' which involves leaving the current code segment entirely for whatever reason. 

The problem really lies with the difference between short jumps and near jumps. 
Given that 90% or more of the conditional jump instructions you'll write target program locations only a few instructions away, it makes sense for NASM to generate opcodes for short jumps by default. 
In fact, NASM generatesopcodes for short jumps unless you explicitly tell it to use near jumps. 
A near jump is specified using the 'NEAR' qualifier: 

	jne Scan 		; Short jump, to within 127 bytes in either direction 
	jne near Scan		; Near jump, anywhere in the current code segment 

The fix is easy: for any jump that NASM calls 'Out of Range' insert the 'NEAR' qualifier between the mnemonic and the target label. 
Leave the other alone.
