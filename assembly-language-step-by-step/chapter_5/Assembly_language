Assembly language is a translator language that allows total control over every individual machine instruction generated by the translator program. 
Such a translator program is called an assembler. 

An assembler see at least one line in the source code file for every machine instruction that it generates.
It typically sees more lines than that, and the additional lines deal with various other things, but every machine instruction in the finak object code file is controlled by a corresponding line in the source code file.

Each of the CPU's many machine instructions has a corresponding mnemonic in assembly language. 

For example, the mnemonic for binary machine instruction 9CH, which pushes the flags register onto the stack, is "PUSHF" which is a country mile easier to remember than 9CH. 

When you write your source code file in assembly language, you arrange series of mnemonics, typically one mnemonic per line in the source code text file. 
A portion of a source code file might look like this: 

		mov eax, 4 		; 04H specifies the sys_write kernel call

		mov ebx, 1 		; 01H specifies stdout
		
		mov ecx, Message	; Load starting address of display string into ECX

		mov edx, MessageLength 	; Load the number of chars to display into EDX

		int 80H; 		; Make the kernel call

The numbers and textual iteams to the immediate right of each mnemonic are that mnemonic's operands. 

Taken together, a mnemonic and its operands are called an instruction. 

The assembler's most important job is to read lines from the source code file and write machine instructions to an object code file.
