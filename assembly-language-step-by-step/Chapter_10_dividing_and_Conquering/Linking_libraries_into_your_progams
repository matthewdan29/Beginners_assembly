The make files are fairly simple. 
Here for example, is the makefile for the hexdump2 program: 

		hexdump2: hexdump2.o
			ld -o hexdump2 hexdum2.o
		hexdump2.o: hexdump2.asm 
			nasm -f elf -g -F stabs hexdump2.asm

The linker invocation converts hexdump2.o into the executable file hexdump2, and that's all it has to do. 
Adding library file complicates the picture slightly.  
The linker now must do some actual linking of multiple files. 
Addtional library files in the .o format are added to the linker invocation after the name of the main program's linkable file. 
There can be any (reasonable) number of .o files in a link step. 
To build hexdump3, we only need two. 
Here is the makefile for hexdump3: 

		hexdump3: hexdump3.o
			ld -o hexdump3 hexdump3.o ../textlib/textlib.o
		hexdump3.o: hexdump3.asm 
			nasm -f elf -g -F stabs hexdump3.asm

The textlib.o file is simply placed on the linker invocation line after the .o file for  the program itself. 
There is one wrinkle in the preceding makefile: the library file is on a path relative to the directory containing the hexdump3 project. 
Placing "../textlib/" in front of the textlib.o filename allows the linker to reach "up, across, and downstream" through the filesystem into the project directory for the library itself. 
Otherwise, you'd have to place textlib.o  in the same directory as hexdump3, or else copy it to a directory under usr/lib, which is on the default search path. 
A directory under usr/lib would actually be a very good place for it, one its finish.
