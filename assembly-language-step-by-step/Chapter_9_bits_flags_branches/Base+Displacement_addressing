A simple and common addressing scheme is Base + Displacement, and It is demonstrated in the hexdump1 program. 
The instruction that inserts an ASCII character into the output line looks like this: 

	mov byte [HexStr+edx+2]

This is a perfect example of a case where there are two displacement terms that NASM combines into one. 
The variable name 'HexStr' resolves to a number (the 32-bit address of 'HexStr') and it is easily added to the literal constant 2, so there is actually only one base term (EDX) and one displacement term.
