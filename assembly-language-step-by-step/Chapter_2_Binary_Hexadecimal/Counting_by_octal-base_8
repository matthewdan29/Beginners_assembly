Counting in octal starts out in a very familiar fashion: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10.
In octal, 10 comes after seven. 

What DEC did not do was invent clever names for the column values. 
The first column is, of course, the units column. 
The next column to the left of the units column is the tens, column, just as it is in our own decimal system. 
The convention in octal has always been to pronounce the numbers as we would in decimal, only with the word octal after them. 
Each column in a given base has a value base times the column to its right, so the "tens" column in octal is actually the eights column. 
The column to the left of the tens column is the hundreds column but the hundreds column actually has a value of 8 times8, or 64. 
The next column to the left has a value of 64 times 8, or 512 and the column left of that has a value of 512 times 8, or 4096. 

THis is why when someone talks about a value of "ten octal" they mean 8; "one hundred octal" means 64. 

A digit in the first column indicates how many units are contained in the octal number. 
A digit in the next column to the left, the tens column, indicates how many eights are contained in the octal number. 
A digit in the third column, the hundreds column indicates how many 64s are in the number, and so on. 
400 octal means that the number four 64s, which is 256 in decimal.
