Most machine instructions, "MOV" included, have one or more operands. 
Consider the machine instructions below: 

		mov eax, 1

There are two operands in the preceding instruction. 
The first is "EAX", and the second is the digit 1. 
By convention in assembly language, the first (left most) operand belonging to a machine instruction is the destination operand. 
The second operand from the left is the source operand. 

With the "MOV" instruction, the sense of the two operands is pretty literal: the source operand is copied to the destination operand. 

Three different flavors of data may be used as operands: 

		1) memory data 

		2) register data 

		3) immediate data
