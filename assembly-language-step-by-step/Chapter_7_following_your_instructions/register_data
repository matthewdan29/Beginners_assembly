Data stored inside a CPU register is known as register data, and accessing register data directly is an addressing mode called register addressing. 
Register addressing is done by simply naming the register you want to work with 
Here are som entirely legal examples of register data and register addressing: 

	mov	ebp,	esi	; 32-bit

	mov 	bl,	ch	; 8-bit

	add 	di,	ax	; 16-bit

	add	ecx, 	edx	; 32-bit

The last tow examples point up the fact that we're not speaking only of the MOV instrucition here
The ADD instruction, adds the source and destination operands. 
The sum replaces whatever was in the destination operand. 
Irrespective of the instruction, register addressing happens any time data in a register is acted on directly.
