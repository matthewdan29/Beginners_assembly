With all of these single-column additions committed to memory, you can tackle multicolumn addition. 
It works pretty mush the same way it does with decimall. 
Add each column starting from the right, and carry into the next column anytime a single column's sum exceeds 0FH.

Here's something you should take note of: 

	"The most you can every carry out of a single-column addition of two numbers is 1"

You will either carry a 1 out of a column, or carry nothing at all.
The largest digit is 9, and 9 + 9 = 18. 
Put down the 8 and carry the 1. 
Even if you have to add in a carry from a previous column, that will bring you up to 19. 
Again, you carry a 1 and no more. 
This is important when you add numbers on paper, or within the silicon of your CPU.
