The identifier "EatMsg" in the .data section defines a variable. 
Specifically, "EatMsg" is a string variable, but as with all cariables, its one of a class of items called "initialized data": something that comes with a value, and not just a box into which we can place a value at some future time. 
A variable is defined by associationg an identifier with a "data definition directive". 
Data definition directives look like this: 

		MyByte		db	07h		; 8 bits in size

		MyWord 		dw	0FFFFh		; 16 bits in size 

		MyDouble	dd 	0B00000h	; 32 bits in size

Think of the "DB" directive as "Define Byte". 
"DB" sets aside one byte of memory for data storage. 
Think of the "DW" directive as "Define Word". 
"DW" sets asisde one word (16 bits, or 2 bytes) of memory for data storage. Thik of the "DD" directive as "Define Double"
"DD" sets aside a double word in memory for storage, typically for full 32-bit memory addresses.
