There is a bewildering array of jump instruction mnemonics, but those dealing with arithmetic relationships sort out well into just six categories, one category for each of the six preceding conditions. 
Complication arises from the fact that there are two nmemonics for each machine instruction - for example, 'JLE' (Jump if Less than or Equal) and 'JNG' (Jump if not Greater Than). 
These two nmemonics are synonyms in that the assembler generates the identical binary opcode when it encounters either mnemonic. 
The synonyms are a convenience to you, the programmer, in that they provide two alternate ways to think about a given jump instruction. 
In the preceding example, 'jump if less than or equal too' is logiclly identical to 'Jump if not greater than'. 
Another complication is that there is a separate set of instructions for signed and unsigned arithmetic comparisons. 
A signed quantity is one in which the high bit of the quantity is considered a built-in flag indicating whether the quantity is negative. 
If that bit is 1, then the quantity is considered negative. 
If that bit is 0, then the quantity is considered positive. 
All you need know to get a high-level understanding of signed arithmetic is that in signed arithmetic, negative quantities are legel and the most significant bit of a value is treated as the sign bit. (if the sign bit is set to 1, then the value is considereed negative.)

Unsigned arithmetic, on the other hand, does not recognize naegative numbers, and the most significant bit is just one more bit in the binary number expressed by the quantity.
