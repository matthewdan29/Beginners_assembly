The very fundamental control sequences like clearing the display and moving the cursor and probably universal, and will liekly work identically on any Linux console you might find.
To ensure that everything works, your programs would have to probe the console to find out what terminal spec it supports, and then issue escape sequences accordingly. 
In knosole (IDK never used it but this is what jeff said one of very few things in this book I haven't tried along with raw mode(but technicaly I use raw mode all the time))  the following escape sequence turns the console background green:
	
	GreenBack: db 27, "[42m"

This is ture in Konsole. 
How universial this sequence and others like it are IDK (He also doen't know LOL)
THe big thing that tell you "I made it" is programming to create full-screen text applications that "paint" a form on the console, complete with data entry fields, and then allow the user to tab from one field to another, entering data in each field. 
This is made diabolically difficult in Linux by the need to access individual keystrokes at the console keyboard, through something called 'raw mode'. 

The standard Unix way to deal with the console is a C library called ncurses, and while ncurses may be called from assembly, it's ugly things indeed. 
A better choice for assembly programmers is a much newer library written specifically for NASM assembly language, called LinuxAsmTools. 
It was written by THE JEFF OWENS!!!, and it does nearly all of what ncurses does without C's brute-force calling conventions and boatloads of C cruft(that should tell you a lot about what your working with).
