The register EAX is 32 bits in size. 
However, you can address the least significant byte of EAX as AL. 
AL is one byte in size, and by using AL you can bring back the first byte of "EatMsg" this way: 

		mov al, [EatMsg]

AL, of course is contained within EAX - its not separate register. 
But the name "AL" allows you to fetch only one byte at a time from memory. 
You can perform a similar trick using the name AX to refer to the lower 2 bytes (16 bits) of EAX: 

		mov ax, [EatMsg]

This time, the characters "E" and "a" are read from memory and placed in the two least significant bytes of EAX. 
Where the size issue gets tricky is when you write data in a register out to memory. 

You have to tell NASM how many bytes of data to move. 
This is done by the "size specifier".
For example: 
		mov [EatMsg], byte 'G'

Here, you tell NASM that you only want to move a single byte out to memory by using the "BYTE" size specifier. 
Other size specifiers include "WORD" (16 bits) and "DWORD" (32 bits)
