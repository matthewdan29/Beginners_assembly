Immediate data is built right into its own machine instruction. 
Register data is stored in one of the CPU's collections of internal registers. 
In constrast, "memory data" is stored somewhere on disk of system memory owned by a program at a 32-bit memory address. 

Only one of an instruction's two operands may specify a memory location. 
You can move an immediate value to memory, or a memory value to a register, or some other similar combination, but you can;t move a memory value directly to another.

To specify that you want the data at the memory location contained in a register, rather than the data in the register itself, you use square brackets around the name of the register. 
To move the word in memory at the address contained in EBX into register EAX, you would use the following instruction: 

		mov eax, [ebx]

The square brackes may contain more than the name of a single 32-bit register. 
For eample you can add a literal constant to a register within the brackest, and NASM will do the math: 

		mov eax, [ebx+16]

The same with adding two general-purpose registers, like so: 

		mov eax, [ebx+ecx]

And, as if that weren't enough, you can add two registers plus a literal constant: 

		mov eax, [ebx+ecx+11]

At the current evolution of the x86 hardware, two registers may be added together to form the effective address, but not three or more. 
The following are not legal effective address forms: 

		mov eax, [ebx+ecx+edx] ; this is invalid

		mov eax, [ebx+ecx+esi+edi] ; this is invalid
