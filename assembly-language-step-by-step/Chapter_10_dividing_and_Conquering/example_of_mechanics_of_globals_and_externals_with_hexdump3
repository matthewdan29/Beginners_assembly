Key take aways for major differences, on library modules and what they lack: 

	A) Exteranl modules do not contain a main program and hence have no start address. 

	B) External modules do not return a to Linux

First take a look at hexdump3.asm
It does precisely the same things as hexdump2. 
Its a lot shorter than hexdump2 from a source code standpoint, because most of its machinery has been outsourced. 
You dont know yet - and you dont have to. 
NASM will put off resolving the addresses of the missing procedures as long as you list all the missing procedures using the "EXTERN" directive. 

External declarations of multiple items may be put on a single line, separated by commas, as in hexdump3.asm: 

	Extern ClearLine, DumpChar, PrintLine

There does not have to be a single 'EXTERN' directive. 
Several may exist in a module; each can have one.


To make hexdump3 link into a functioning executable program, we havt to create an external library modula for all of its procedures. 
All thats needed are the procedures and thier data in the proper sections, and the necessary 'GLOBAL' declarations, as shown in the file 'textlib.asm'

There are two lines of global identifier declarations, each line with its own 'GLOBAL' directive. 
As a convention in my own work (Jeff voice I do it the same too, but I do one each line if its all on one page like a glob), he separate declarations of procedures and named data items, and give each their own line: 

	GLOBAL ClearLine, DumpChar, Newlines, PrintLine		; Procedures
	GlOBAL DumpLin, HexDigits, BinDigits

Any proedure or data item that is to be exported must be declared on the line after a 'GLOBAL' directive. 
You don't have to declare anything in the module global. 
A module can have "private" produres and named data items that can only be referenced from inside the module. 
Making these items private is in fact the default: just don't declare them global. 
Equates can be exported from modules, though this is an innovation of the NASM assembler and not necessarily true to all assemblers.
