The obj file format (NASM calls it obj rather than omf for historical reasons) is the one produced by MASM and TASM, which is typically fed to 16-bit DOS linkers to produce .EXE files. 
It is alos the format used by OS/2. 

OBJ provides a default output file-name extension of .obj

obj is not exclusively a 16-bit format, though; NASM has full support for the 32-bit extensions to the format. 
In particular, 32-bit obj format files are used by Borland's Win32 compilers, instead of using Microsoft newer win32 object file format. 

The obj format does not define any special segment names: you can call your segments anything you like. 
Typical names for segments in obj format files are CODE, DATA and BSS. 

If your source file contains code before specifying an explicit "SEGMENT" directive, then NASM will invent its own segment called "__NASMDEFSEG" for you. 

When you define a sement in an obj file, NASM defines the segment name as a symbol as well, so that you can access the segment address of the segment. 
So for example: 

		segment data 

		dvar:	dw	1234

		segment code 

		function: 

			mov	ax, data		; get segment address of data 

			mov 	ds, ax			; and move it into DS 

			inc 	word 	[dvar]		; now this regerence will work 

			ret

The obj format also enables the use of the SEG and WRT operations, so that you can write code which does things like

		extern foo

			mov	ax, seg foo			; get preferred segment of foo

			mov	ds, ax		

			mov 	ax, data			; a different segment 

			mov 	es, ax		

			mov	ax, [ds:foo]			; this accesses 'foo'


			mov	[es:foo wrt data], bx		; so does this
