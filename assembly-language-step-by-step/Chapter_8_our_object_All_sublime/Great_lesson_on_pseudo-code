I wasn't going to making this file but this  is a great lesson on pseudo-code everyone should know. 

Once you understand the nature of the problem as thoroughly as possible you can begin crafting a solution. 
At the outset.
You state a solution in a very broad from and in as few statemsnts as possible. 
Then, little by little, you refine the stated solution by breaking down the larger steps into the smaller steps that the larger steps contain.
