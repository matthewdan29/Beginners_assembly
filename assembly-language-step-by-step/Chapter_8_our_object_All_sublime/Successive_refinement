Again this is something ever programmer should know by heart. 

From out first complete but detailed-challenged statement of the solution, we move toward a more detailed statement of the solution. 
We do this by defining the pseudo-code statements so that each is more specific about how the action being described is to be done. 
We repeat this process, adding more details every time, until what we have can be readily translated into actual assembly language instructions. 
This process, called "Successive refinement" is not specific to assembly language. 
Its used with all programming languages to one degree or another but it works especially well for assembly.
