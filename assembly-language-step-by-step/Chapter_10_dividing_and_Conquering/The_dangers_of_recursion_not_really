Calling procedures from within procedures requires you to pay at least a little attention to one thing: stack space. 
Remember that each procedure call pushes a 32-bit return address onto the stack. 
This return address is not removed from the stack until the 'RET' instruction for that procedure executes. 
If you execute another 'CALL' instruction before returning from a procedure, then the second 'CALL' instruction pushes another return address onto the stack. 
If you keep calling procedures from within procedures, then one return address will pile up on the stack for each 'CALL' until you start returning from all those nested procedures. 

However, you can still get in trouble by misusing an advanced programming technique called recursion. 
In recursion, a procedure calls itself to get its work done. 
For every call to itself a recursive procedure must eventually execute a "RET". 
Even if the recursive procedure calls itself dozens of hundreds of times, as long as the 'CALL' instruction balance the 'RET' instructions, nothing bad will happen. 
ON a modern PC, an assembly language procedure can call itself a million times in a second or less. 
At that point the stack collides with the code and Linux hands you a segmentation fault.
