This is good, because going in the other direction, from our familiar decimal base 10 to hex, is much easier and involves little mor math. 
What we have to do is find the hex column values "within" a decimal number -- and that involves some long division. 

Starting with decimal numbers: 499. 
The calculator will be handy with a vengeance. 
Tap in the number 449 and store it in the calculator's memory. 

What we need to do first is find the larget hex column value that is contained in 449 at least once. 
Looking back at "Hexadecimal_columns_as_powers_of_16_chart_written_Yes_this_is_very_important" text file, we can see that 256 is the largest power of 16, and hence the largest hex column value, that is present in 449 at least once. 

Therefore, we start with 256, and determine how many times 256 goes into 449: 449 / 256 = 1.7539. 
At least once, but not quite twice, so 449 contains only one 256. 
Write down a 1 on paper. 
We're keeping a running remainder. 
The "1" is the left most hex digit of the hex value that is equivalent to decimal 449.. 

We know that only one 256 is contained in 449. 
What we must do now is remove that 256 from the original number, now that we've "counted" it by writing a 1 down on paper. 
Subtract 256 from 449. 
Store the difference, 193, into memory. 

The 256 column has been removed from the number we're converting. 
now we move to the next column to the right, the 16s. 
How many 16s are contained in 193?
193 / 16 = 12.0625. 
This means the 16s column in the hex equivalent of 449 contains a 12.
The value we call 12 is repreented by the letter C. 
From a hex perspective, we have found that the original number contains C in the 16s column. 
Write a C down to the right of you 1: 1C. 

We've got the 16s column, so just as with the 256s, we have to remove the 16s from what's left of the original number. 
The total value of the 16s column is C X 16 = 12 X 16 = 192. 
Bring the 193 from it. 
A lonely little 1 is al that's left. 

There is one unit in one. 
Write that 1 down to the right of the C in our hexadecimal number: 1C1. 
Decimal 449 is equivalent to hex 1C1. 

Look back at the big picture of the decial-to-hex convertion. 
Looking for the hexadecimal columns hidden in the decimal value. 
We find the largest column contained in the decimal number,find that column's value, and subtract that value from the decimal number. 
then we look for the next smallest hex column, and the next smallest, and so on, removing the value of each column from the decimal number as we go. 
We're dividing the number by consecutively smaller powers of 16 and keeping a running remainder by removing each column as we tally it 

Try it again. Convert 988664 to hex-value: 
				NOTE: make sure you start off by seeing how many times 16 goes into 988664
	1) Find the largest column contained in 988664, from the hex_chart_file: 65536. 988,664 / 65536 = 15 and change. Ignore the change. 15 = F in hex. write down the F. 

	2) Remove F X 65536 from 988664. Store the remainder: 5,624

	3) Move to the next smallest column. 5624 / 4096 = 1 and change. Write down the 1. 

	4) Remove 1 X 4096 from the remainder: 5624 - 4096 = 1528. Store the new remainder 1528. 

	5) Move to the next smallest column. 1528 / 256 = 5 and change. Write down the 5

	6) Remove 5 5 X 256 from the stored remainder, 1528. Store 248 as the new remainder. 

	7) Move to the next smallest column. 248 / 16 = 15 and change. 15 = F in hex. Write down the F. 

	8) Remove F X 16 from stored remainder, 248. The remainder, 8, is the number of units in the final column. Write down the 8. 

There you have it 988664 decimal = F15F8H. 

Not the presence of the H at the end of the hex number. 
It's important because not every hex number contains letter digits to scream out the fact that the number is in base 16. 
There is a 157H as surely as a 157 decimal, and the two are not the same number. 
Don't forget that H in writing your assembly programs.
