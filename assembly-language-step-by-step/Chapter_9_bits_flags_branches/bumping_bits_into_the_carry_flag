The last bit shifted out of the left end of the binary number is bumped into a temporary bucket for bits called the carry flag, generally abbreviated as CF. 
Keep in mind when using shfit instrctions that a low tof different instructions use the Carry flag not only the shift instructions. If you bump a bit into the Carry flag with the intent of testing that bit later to see what it is, test it before you execute another instruction that affects the carry flag.
This includes all the arithmetic instructions, all the bitwise logical instruftions, all the other shift instructions too. 

If you shift a bit into the Carry flag and then immediately exectue another shift instruction, that first bit will be bumped off the end
