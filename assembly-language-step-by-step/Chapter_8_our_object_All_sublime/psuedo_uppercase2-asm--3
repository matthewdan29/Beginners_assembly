Read: Set up registers for the 'sys_read' kernel call. Call 'sys_read' to read a buffer full of characters from 'stdin'. Store the number of characters read in 'esi' Test for the 'EOF' (eax = 0). If we're at 'EOF', jump to Exit

Scan: Compare the byte at [ebp_ecx] against 'a'. If the byte is below 'a' in the ASCII sequence, jump to the Next. Compare the byte to [ebp+ecx] against 'z'. If the byte is above 'z' in the ASCII sequence, jump to Next. Subtract 20h from the byte at [ebp+ecx]. 

Next: Decrement ecx by one. Jump if not zero to Scan. 

Write: Set up registers for the Write Kernel call. Call 'sus_write' to write the processed buffer to 'stdout'. Jump back to Read and get another buffer full of characters. 

Exit: set up registers for terminating the program via 'sys_exit'. Call 'sys_exit'.

This refinement recognizes that there is not one test to be made, but two. 
Lowercase characters represent a range in the ASCII sequence, and range have beginnings and ends. 
We have to determine if the character under examination falls within the range. 
Doing that requires testing the character to see if it's either below the lowest character in the lowercase range ("a") or above the highest character in the lowercase range ("z"). 
If the character in question is not lowercase, no processing is required, and we jump to the code that bumps the pointer to the next character.
