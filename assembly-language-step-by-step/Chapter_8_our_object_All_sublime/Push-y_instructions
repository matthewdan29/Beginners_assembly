Here are some exaples of the "PUSH" family of instructions in use: 

		pushf		; Push the Flags register 

		pusha		; Push AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, and DI, in the order all at once

		pushad 		; Push EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, ESP, EBP, ESI, and EDI, all at once

		push ax		; Push the AX register

		push eax	; Push the EAX register

		push [bx]	; Push the word stored in memory at BX

		push [edx]	; Push the doubleword in memory at EDX

		push edi	; Push the EDI register

Note that "PUSHF" and "PUSHFD" take no operands. 
You'lll generate an assembler error if you try to hand them operands; the two instructions push the flags and that's all they're capable of doing.
