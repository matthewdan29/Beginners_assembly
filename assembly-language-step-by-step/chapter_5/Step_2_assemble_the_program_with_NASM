Open a terminal window. 
Many different terminal utilities are available for Linux just USE BASH. 
Once you have the command prompt, navigate to the "eatsyscall" project directory using the "cd" command.

Assuming that the file eatsyscall.asm is present, assemble it by entering the following command and pressing enter

		"nasm -f elf -g -F stabs eatsyscall.asm"

When NASM finds nothing wrong, it will say nothing, and you will simply get the command prompt back. 
That means the assembly worked! (nasm -f bin -o myprogram.exe source.asm "This works for windows VIA bing.com")


(This is to change the  name of the file object out put nasm-f elf-g-F stabs eatsyscall.asm-o eatdemo.o "Just like C/C++")
