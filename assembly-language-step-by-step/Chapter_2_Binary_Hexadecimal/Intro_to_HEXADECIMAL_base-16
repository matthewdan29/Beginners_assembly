Hexadecimal shares the essential characteristics of any number base. 
It is a columnar notation, in which each column has a value 16 times the value of the column to its right. 
It has 16 digits, running from 0 to 15. 
Without any additional numeric digits, the people who developed hexadecimal notation in the early 1950s borrowed the first six letters of the alphabet to act as the needed digits. 

Counting in hexadecimal, then, goes like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, and so on,
