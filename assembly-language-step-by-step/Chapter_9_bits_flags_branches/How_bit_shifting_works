Understanding the shfit instruction requires that you think of numbers being shfited as binary numbers.
A simpel example would start with register AX containing a value of 0B76FH. 
Expressed as a binary number, 0B76FH is as follows: 

		1011011101101111

Keep in mind that each digit in a binary number is one bit. 
If you execute an 'SHL' 'AX', 1 instruction, what you'd find in AX after the shift is the following: 

		0110111011011110

A 0 has been insterted at the right-hand end of the number, and the whole number has been bumped toward the left by one digit. 
Notice that a 1 bit has been bumped off the left end of the number
