Here are some examples of "POP" family of code: 

	popf		; Pop the top 2 bytes from the stack into Flags

	popa		; Pop the top 16 bytes from the stack into AX, CX, DX, BX, BP SI, and DI... but not SP

	popad		; Pop the top 32 bytes from the stack into EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, EBP, ESI and EDI... but not ESP

	popad		; Pop the top 32 bytes from the stack into EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, EBP, ESI, and EDI... but not ESP

	pop cx		; Pop the top 2 bytes from the stack into CX

	pop esi		; Pop the top 4 bytes from the stack into ESI

	pop [ebx] 	; Pop the top 4 bytes from the stack into memory at EBX

as with "Push" "POP" only operates on 16-bit or 32-bit operands. dont try 8


Getting Flags into BX is thus done like this: 

	PUSHF		; Push the flags register onto the stack...

	POP BX		; ...and pop it immediatly into BX

Not all bits of EFlags may be changed with "POPFD". 
Bits VM and RF are not affected by popping a value off the stack into EFlags
