A kernel services call gate is a hardware-managed gate in memory (like the GDT (Global Descriptor Table)) that acts as a secure, controlled doorway for less previlieged user-mode programs (ring 3) to eecute highly provilieged code in the kernel (Ring 0). 
Its specific type of descriptor that allows a CALL FAR instruction in user space to trigger a privilege level change and jump to a kernel function, handleing stack switching and parameter passing automatically, which is essential for secure system calls but largely replaced by faster methods like sysenter in modern OSes 


Call gate:
	Is a mechanism in intel's x86 architecture for changing the privilege level of a process when it executes a predifined function call using a CALL FAR instruction. 
Call gates are intended to allow less previleged code to call code with a higher privilege level. 
This type of mechanism is essential in modern operating systems that employ memory protection since it allows user applications to use kernek functions and system calls in a way that can be controlled by the OS

Call gates use a special selector value to reference a descriptor accessed via the global descriptor table or the local descriptor table, which containes the infomation needed for the call across privilege boundaries. 
this is similar to the mechanism used for interrupts. 

Global Discriptor Table (GDT): 
	Is a core part of Intel's x86 architecture that helps manage how memory is accessed and protected. It plays a key role in defining memory segments and their attributes: the base address, the size, and access privileges like executablilty and writablility. 
The GDT helps isolate memory between application software and the operating system
