If the assembler encounters something it doesn't understand when it reads a line from the source code file, the misunderstood text is called an "error", and the assembler displays an "error message". 
For example, the following line of assembly language will confuse the assembler and prompt an error message: 

		mov eax, evx

The reason is simple: there's no such thing as "EVX". 
What comes cou as EVX was actually intended to be "EBX", which is the name of a CPU register. 

							NOTE: 

THe assembler will terminate, having printed numerous error messages. 
Start at the first one, make sure you understand it and keep going. 
If the erros following the first one don't make sense, fix the first one or two and assemble again.
