Linux has a fairly convenient method for displaying text to your screen. 
The problem is that it only displays text - if you want to display a numberic value from a register as a pair of hex digits, Linux won't help. 
You first have to convert the numberic value into its string representation, and then display the string representation by calling the 'sys_write' kernel service via 'INT 80h'. 

Converting the hexadecimal numbers to hexadecimal digits isn't difficult, and the code that does the job demonstrates several of the new concepts we're exploring.
The code is bare-bones core of a hex dump utility, rather like a read-only version of the Bless Hex Editor. 
When you redirect its input from a file of any kind, it will read that file 16 bytes at a time, and display those 16 bytes in a line, as 16 hexadecimal values separated by spaces. 

The hexdump1 program is at its heart a filter program. 
The important parts of the program for this discussion are the parts that read 16 bytes from the input buffer and convert them to a string of characters for display to the Linux console. 
This is the code between the label 'Scan' and the 'INT 80h' exit call. 
I'll be referring to that block of code in the diescussion that follows (remember this if Jeff talking I'm just writing/typing please type out the program hexdump1.asm)
