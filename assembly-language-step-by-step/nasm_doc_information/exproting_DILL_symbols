The EXPORT format-specific directive defines a global symbol to be exported as a DLL symbol, for use if you are writing a DLL in NASM. 
You still need to declare the symbol as GLOBAL as well as using the EXPORT directive. 

EXPORT takes one required parameter, which is the name of the symbol you wish to export, as it was defined in your source file. 
An optional second parameter (separtaed by white space from the first) gives the external name of the symbol:  the name by which you wish the symbol to be known to programs using the DLL. 
If this name is the same as the internal name, you make leave the second parameter off. 

Further parameters can be given to define attributes of the exported symbol. 
These parameters, like the second, are separted by white space. 
If further parameters are given, the external name must also be specified, even if it is the same as the internal name. 


For example: 

		export	myfunc
		export	myfunc TheRealMoreFormalLookingFunctionName
		export	myfunc myfunc 1234	; export by ordinal 
		export	myfunc myfunc resident parm=23 nodata
