Several x86 machine instructions come in pairs. 
Simplest among those are the "INC" and "DEC", which increment and decrement an operand by one, respectively. 
Adding one to soemthing or subtracting one from something are actions that happen a lot in computer programming. 
If you're counting the number of times that the program is executing the loop or counting bytes in the table or doing something that advances or retreats one count at a time, "INC" or "DEC" can be very quick ways to make the actual addition or subtraction happen. 

Both "INC" and "DEC" take only one operand. 
An error will be flagged by the assembler if you try to use either "INC" or "DEC" with two operand, or without any operands 

Try both by adding the following instructions to your sandbox. 
Build the sandbox as usal, load the executable into GDB and step through it: 

		mov eax, 0FFFFFFFFh
		
		MOV ebx, 02Dh

		dec ebx

		inc eax

Watch what happens to the EAX and EBX registers. 
Decrementing EBX prdictably turns the value 2DH into value 2CH. 
Incrementing 0FFFFFFFh, on the other hand rolls over the EAX register to 0, becaus 0FFFFFFFH is the largest unsigned value that can be expressed in a 32-bit reg. 
Adding 1 to it rolls it over to zero, just as adding 1 to 99 rolls to 100
