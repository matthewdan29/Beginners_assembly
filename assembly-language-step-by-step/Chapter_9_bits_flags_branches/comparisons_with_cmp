One major use of flags is in controlling loops. 
Another is in comparisons between two values. 
Your programs will often need to know whether a value in a register or memory is equal to some other value. 
Further, you may want to know if a value is greater than a value or less than a value if it is not equal to the value. 
There is a jump instruction to satisfy every need, nut something has to set the flags for the benefit of the jump instruction. 
The 'CMP' (CoMPare) instruction is what sets the flags for compison tasks. 
'CMP''s use is straightforward and intuitive. 
The second operand is compared with the first, and several flags are set accordingly: 

	cmp <op1>, <op2>		; Sets OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF

The sense of the comparison can be remembered if you simply recast the comparison in arithmetic terms: 

	Result = <op1> - <op2>

'CMP' is very mush a subtraction operation whereby the result of the subtraction is thrown, away, and only the flags are affected. 
The second operand is subtracted from the first. 
Based on the results of the subtraction, the other flags are set to appropriate values. 

After a 'CMP' instruction, you can jump based on serveral arithmetic conditions. 

The conditions: 'EQUAL', 'not equal', 'Greater than', 'Less Than', 'Greater than or equal to ', and 'less than or equal too'.
